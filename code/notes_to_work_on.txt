OCaml is unpopular - hit not at all or hit it funnier
One of the few commercial users

There are requirements we have for the software
-correctness
-agility
-performance

Hit the correctness -scariness point harder
Emote more about all the problems section
	- every strategy is constantly going away
	
For the correctness slide - talk without bullets

15 Gbps - Your home connection might be 10Mb maybe 50 if you have a really nice system

Performance -- 
This matters for lots of things 

Busier times are when we make the most money and when it's most important to be fast
this is not the biggest data problem (nothing on the size of fb or goog, but we need to respond quickly)
 - both r/t and historical

The ability to process 5mil msgs/sec is important both for real time
and to look at historical data for years


Make sure to go slowly through code, apologize about confusing and really push them to ask questions

Code is read, changed and used wayyy more often than it's written
Spend more time on this 

Null ptr exceptions just do not happen in OCaml

different languages are different 
- they effect how you think about and approach probles

Clean up why does this matter








Talk a bit more about my background at the beginning
- where I went to school, how I came to jane street, what I do here
- please ask question during the talk if things are unclear

Agiility slide - mention innovation on the slide and 
Talk about innovation and new ideas before explain adr/ord example


Present why this matters in the introduction



we have a very small number of developers.  Twitter has 2k developers for... twitter There is a ton of complexity  of 2% of us equity volume with 100 devs
Different languages are different
They make different kinds of problems easier to solve
They change how you think and approach problems
